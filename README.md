# Scientific Calculator
A simple C++ project

## Introduction
A scientific calculator is one of the first projects that most people make,
whether their language is C/C++, Python, JavaScript, Ruby, Go, Kotlin, etc.
Every single designated language has to be able to make a scientific calculator;
all modern languages have functions and libraries for math.

## Goal of this project
I see many people making calculators, using things like:
* ``using namespace std;``
* Many ``else if`` conditions
* Redundant practices
* No modern C++
* ``bits/stdc++.h``: ... Why? WHY?!

## Requirements
* Basic arithmetic calculations
* sin, cos, tan functions, with radians and degrees options.
* At least one recursive function (Factorial in my case)

**This project was made for fun, and I do plan to expand it later.** This project uses unordered maps
and std::function as an alternative to many else if statements, object-oriented programming, (a few) macros,
and a few other stuff. Feel free to download and edit it. Raise an issue if you find a bug, and I'll fix it in
no time.
